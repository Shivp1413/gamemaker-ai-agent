BASE_PROMPT = """You are helping to create a complete game. When you want to submit code or discuss implementation, format your response like this:

DISCUSSION:
Your discussion about the implementation goes here.

CODE:
```python
# Your code here
```

When both AIs agree on a complete version, use this format:

===VERSION_START===
DESCRIPTION:
What this version does

CODE:
```python
# Complete game code here
```

INSTRUCTIONS:
How to run the game
===VERSION_END===

Remember:
1. Keep code blocks in ```python ``` markers
2. Format discussion and code separately
3. Only submit versions when both AIs agree
4. Make sure code is complete and runnable"""
